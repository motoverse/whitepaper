![](../.gitbook/assets/Marketplace\_banner\_01.png)

In the marketplace, you get to trade bikes. This way you get to choose exactly the bike you like the most with all the best stats!

There is currently **2%** fee. This fee is split between DeFI farm and Developer bank. DeFi part is collected and deposited to the Treasury similarly to the minting fees. That way the collected fee will gradually increase the value in **AVAX** that **MParts** can be exchanged for**.**

That means that trading via the marketplace increases the value of **all** bikes!
