What more you can sign up your bike on for a race!&#x20;

With Motoverse, you get access to all kinds of events. Weâ€™re working hard to make the experience of participating in races fun and exciting.

As a reward for playing the game you will get rewarded of course.&#x20;

### Moto Parts

One type of reward that you can get from a race is our in-game token MotoParts or **MParts** for short.

MParts may be yet to gain its full potential, but you can use it in exchange for AVAX tokens now. This is where the play-to-earn mechanics come into effect!

### Experience

For participating in the events you also get another crypto token **MExp.** This is a token that marks you as a veteran rider. It is not transferable and gives you acces to several perks and tools.
