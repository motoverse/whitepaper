Good news for everyone, who likes customization and variety!

Each motorbike can be upgraded for MParts to improve NFT's performance, traits and value. In Motoverse, Upgrades are not just numbers like in other DeFi games, but they actually change the visuals of your motorbike!

#### Traits

Motorbikes have the following traits:

* Speed
* Acceleration
* Handling
* Grip
* Protection

Traits have an effect on how motorbike performs in races and activities. So watch out, if the race or activity you are signing-in is suitable for your motorbike!

#### Classes

Moreover, we offer various Classes of motorbikes, while each one is more or less suitable for different situations. This is reflected in the motorbike's traits.

Motorbike Classes are following:

* Classic - universal motorbike suitable for most of the situations with mediocre results
* Cruiser - these motorbikes are Durable and Accelerate fast, but Handling is not the best
* Offroad - improved Handling and Grip is an advantage in rough terrain but lacks Speed
* Sport - Speed is the main strength of this class, but Protection is weak
